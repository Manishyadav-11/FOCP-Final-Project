# Introduction to Programming – Week 1 Summary

## Overview

This lab introduces the basics of programming using **Python**. It helps beginners understand how programming languages work and how to use the Python interpreter.

## Programming Languages

* **3GL (Third Generation Languages)** like Python are general-purpose and easy to use.
* **4GL (Fourth Generation Languages)** like SQL focus on *what* you want, not *how* to do it.
* Python is **interpreted**, meaning code is run line by line using an **interpreter**.
* Python supports multiple programming styles (procedural, object-oriented, etc.).

## Python Interpreter

* Python uses the **REPL** model: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.
* Commands are type -->d at the `>>>` prompt.
* `print()` is used to display output.
* Previous commands can be reused using arrow keys.
* The `help()` function provides built-in documentation.
* Exit Python using `quit()` or keyboard shortcuts.

## Expressions and Operators

* Expressions perform calculations (e.g. `45 + 20`).
* Common operators include:

  * `+` addition
  * `-` subtraction
  * `*` multiplication
  * `/` division
  * `//` floor division
  * `%` remainder
  * `**` power
* **Operator precedence** decides calculation order.
* Parentheses `()` change the order of execution.

## Errors

* **Syntax errors**: mistakes in code structure (e.g. missing values).
* **Logical errors**: code runs but gives wrong results.
* **Runtime errors**: errors while the program is running (e.g. divide by zero).
* Error messages help identify and fix problems.

## Key Terms

* **Source code**: code written by humans.
* **Machine code**: code understood by computers.
* **Interpreter**: runs code line by line.
* **Compiler**: converts code into an executable file.
* **Executable**: a program that can be run.
* **Operators & Operands**: symbols and values used in expressions.
